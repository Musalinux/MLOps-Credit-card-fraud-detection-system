# üöÄ MLOps-Based Credit Card Fraud Detection System on AWS

## üìå Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a critical challenge faced by the fintech industry, resulting in billions of dollars in annual losses. Traditional methods struggle to adapt to the evolving tactics of fraudsters. This project focuses on developing a **Cloud-Native, Scalable, and Automated Credit Card Fraud Detection System** using **MLOps principles** and **AWS services**.

‚úÖ **Goal:** Leverage Machine Learning and Cloud Infrastructure to build a **real-time fraud detection pipeline** capable of handling large volumes of transactions with **high accuracy** and **minimal latency**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow (MLOps Pipeline)

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Raw transaction files (CSV/JSON) uploaded to S3 (`fraud-raw-transactions`).

2. **Event Trigger**
   - AWS EventBridge detects new files and triggers Step Functions.

3. **ETL & Feature Engineering**
   - Step Functions orchestrate AWS Glue Job execution.
   - Glue Job reads raw data, performs cleaning, feature engineering, and writes Parquet data to S3 (`fraud-processed-transactions`).

4. **Fraud Detection Inference**
   - Step Functions invoke AWS Lambda (or SageMaker Endpoint) for fraud prediction on the processed data.

5. **Result Storage**
   - Fraudulent transactions are stored in DynamoDB and flagged data is stored in S3 (`fraud-fraudulent-transactions`).

6. **Alerts & Notifications**
   - SNS sends real-time alerts (Email/Slack) for detected frauds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Components & AWS Services Configuration

### 1. S3 Buckets
- `fraud-raw-transactions`
- `fraud-processed-transactions`
- `fraud-fraudulent-transactions`

### 2. AWS Glue
- **Glue Crawler**: Auto-detects schema and populates Glue Catalog.
- **Glue Job (PySpark)**: Cleans and transforms data, outputs Parquet files.

### 3. AWS EventBridge
- Event Rule triggers when files are added to `fraud-raw-transactions`.

### 4. AWS Step Functions
- Orchestrates the flow: ETL -> Fraud Prediction -> Storage -> Alerts.

### 5. AWS Lambda (or SageMaker)
- Runs the ML model to predict fraud.
- Lambda processes small batches, SageMaker handles large-scale inference.

### 6. DynamoDB
- Stores fraud predictions with transaction details.

### 7. SNS (Simple Notification Service)
- Sends email/SMS alerts to security teams.
